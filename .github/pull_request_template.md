Thank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:

1. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.

2. In a new feature or configuration option, consider updating the documentation in README.md(https://github.com/grafana/grafana-iot-twinmaker-app/blob/main/README.md) or [src/README.md](https://github.com/grafana/grafana-iot-twinmaker-app/blob/main/src/README.md).

3. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's "Draft PR" feature and mark it as such.

4. If you cannot merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.
